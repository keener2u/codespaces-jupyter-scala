# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to your shiny new codespace! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Scala, Spark and Jupyter notebooks.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

# Errata
*Codespaces does not always completely purge containers. If you get any out of space errors during build go into the recovery and run a Full Container Rebuild
*There seems to be some issues with container entrypoints depending on if you connect to the container using Jupyter Lab as your editor vs VS Code
